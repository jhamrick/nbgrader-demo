Looking up [`subplots`](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots) in the matplotlib documentation, we see that this method returns as many axis objects as there are cells in a subplot grid. In our case, since we specified a grid of size $2 \\times 1$, it returned two separate axis objects inside a single array. When we asked Python to access the `plot` method of our array on line 7, it understandably got confused -- arrays don't have a `plot` method! With this in mind, we can adjust our code to resolve the issue. One solution would be ignore the second subplot entirely:"
